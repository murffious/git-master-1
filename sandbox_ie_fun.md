HOW DO I MAKE CODING FUN AND MASTER IT FASTER ?


#1 Goal - USE THE CONCEPTS/CODE TAUGHT IN CLASS EACH DAY IN A MEANINGFUL [TO YOU] WAY. 
- Use a sandbox folder to create a new file and re use the specific activity/code in a NEW way. 
- Make it funny or serious with cool new funcitonality .     

YOU MUST OWN THE CODE - you do this by making it personal and tie it to something meaningful to you- 
- Share you new creation with a TA/Instructor or in Slack with someone/class. This helps you stay excited just like posting on Facebook or Insta or what not.  

#2 Keep doing Codewars type problems everyday if you can. This helps engrain the coding thought process.
