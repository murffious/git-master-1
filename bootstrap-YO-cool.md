### READY SET GO

1. (CLICK THIS LINK)[https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/]
2. COPY AND PASTE 2 ITEMS (blocks of code) from the link
  - a. look for CSS and go to right side for COPY button(kinda small) - click it it will copy this to clipboard for ctrl v paste later `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-MCw98/SFnGE8fJT3GXwEOngsV7Zt27NXFoaoApmYm81iuXoPkFOJwJ8ERdknLPMO" crossorigin="anonymous">` - now go paste this in the <head> tag area of the index.html file
  - b. look for JS Header and go below it as well to right and find the COPY button, click that and it should copy this to clipboard `<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`
`<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.3/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-ZMP7rVo3mIykV+2+9J3UJ46jBk0WLaUAdn689aCwoqbBJiSnjAK/l8WvCWPIPm49" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`
`<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-ChfqqxuZUCnJSK3+MXmPNIyE6ZbWh2IMqE241rYiqJxyMiZ6OW/JmZQ5stwEULTy" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>` -- now go paste that with ctrl or cmd v right below the other one in head tag area
  
  3. Scroll down the left menu of the bootstrap site page we are on till you see Components - now click that
  4. on the left side menu again scroll down till you see Navbar click it 
  5. Scroll down main page area until you see a real Navbar with buttons and stuff and a search input etc.  Right below to the right of the green search button it says COPY click that. again that copies to clipboard for ctrl v later.
  6. Go back to index.html file and ctrl or cmd v once you CLICK inside the <body> tag of the file so right below that tag there - then save and see if it worked by looking a browser loaded version of it - open in browser
  7. okay if it worked continue (it should look exactly like the version we just copied from the site) if NOT stop and start over
  8. Now on the left menu again on the site of bootstrap scroll up till you see Card and click it 
  9. In the main area of the newly loaded page scroll down till you see a fancy looking card with a blue button that says "Go Somewhere" . Once you see it go right below to the right again and click COPY yay again and it is on clipboard again.
  10. Go to index.html again and paste this into the body again right below out last pasted code and hit CTRL or CMD S for save then reload the browser to see if it worked - should be there
  11. ADD a real image to the img tag - just google a cool image and hit copy image address after right clicking on it and paste into src= area
  12. add a real link to your github profile to the BUTTON by putting the URL to your github main page in the HREF area
  13. SAVE and reload to check - if all is well save and follow the other readme here for git and host this file and do all that is needed to do that 
  
  DONE - if more than 10 min then its cool but we need to redo then. lol
