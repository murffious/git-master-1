*LOW LEVEL* - Low level languages are used to write programs 
that relate to the specific architecture and hardware of a 
particular type of computer.They are closer to the native language
of a computer (binary), making them harder for programmers to understand.

*HIGH LEVEL* - High level languages are written in a form 
that is close to our human language, enabling to programmer
to just focus on the problem being solved. No particular 
knowledge of the hardware is needed as high level languages 
create programs that are portable and not tied to a particular 
computer or microchip.These programmer friendly languages 
are called ‘high level’ as they are far removed from the machine
code instructions understood by the computer.

Examples include: C++, Java, Pascal, Python, Visual Basic.
