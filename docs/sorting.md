Students should be able to explain why choosing an algorithm involve tradeoffs.

 "Selection Sort"
 
 
 
 tradeoff between performant and readable code.
  efficiencies of sorting algorithms depends on things like:

How big the data set is—insertion sort is a good default for small arrays.
How ordered the data is—i.e., whether it's completely out of order, or partially sorted.
How many unique elements there are.
