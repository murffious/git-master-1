### Good to know 

(The Processor- multitasking)[https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/386100/what_difference_between_an_intel_core_i3_i5_i7_/]
RAM (Computer Memory)- More RAM allows for more applications to be run at the same time, and for more data to be quickly accessible by the system at any one time
Essentially, the more rams you have, the more browsers and applications you can open. I think you need at least 12-16GB of Ram in the long run(opinion) but can be fine iwth 8Gb too. Make sure you get windows vista 64bit as your operating system.
Hard Drive versus SSD 
Graphics 4K 1920x1080-pixel resolution (Full HD) - why what 
Task Manager -  Activity Monitor - knowing and controlling(killing computer processes without restarting)
Hidden Files 


#### What do you need to know about "do you really understand how computers work."  before coming to bootcamp or learning how to code?
a professional tool for creating software 
ALL about cpoy and paste - i.e. Right click on track pad or mouse after highlighing some stuff. 
Copying images and image URL with right click basically all about right clicking and what it can do.
Also basic HOT KEYS like CTRL C CTRL V or CMD C CMD V on a mac. (need two versions here instead)

making cool sites need to know what is out there and what users expect so join and find at least 4 web based sites like Facebook Amazon or tools that you really enjoy and create free accounts or even if you have to pay. If you don't like any web sites a lot or hate tech in general then web dev might be very frustrating, this is only true in general.

Have a gmail account.
